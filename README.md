# Music Player Website

A Simple Music Player app made purely using HTML and CSS, the idea was to make the app look good and it should be user friendly irrespective of the device. The approach was simple, first I have structured the layout of both page using HTML, make it look good by styling using CSS and the used media tag to control the responsiveness. Since I have not used any Api , So I have created an basic template for single playlist and home page. Simultaneously we also have fixed dummy music controller at the bottom.
